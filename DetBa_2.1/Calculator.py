#
#    This module replaces both 'pop2matrix.py', and 'rate2gibbs.py' from the previous iteration of DetBa.sh.
#    Calculator.py has three methods build into it:
#
#        - pop2rate    : Creates a rate-matrix, calculated from the population matrix; which was calculated in 'Propogator.py'
#
#            Inputs    : Initial bin (init), Final bin (fina), population matrix (pop_matrix), bin size (bin_size)
#            Outputs    : Rate Matrix (markov)
#
#
#        - rate2gibbs    : Uses values from the matrix matrix, and calculates the gibbs free energy for the transitions between bins.
#
#            Inputs     : Initial bin (init), Final bin (fina), rates matrix (matrix), bin size (bin_size), output file (outname)
#            Outputs    : 'Free-Energy vs. Position'
